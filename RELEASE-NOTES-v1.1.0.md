# NOLA Holi Theme v1.1.0 - Release Notes

**Release Date:** October 10, 2025

## üéâ Major New Feature: Google Photos Integration

This release introduces automatic photo fetching from Google Photos shared albums, eliminating the need to manually upload hundreds of photos to WordPress!

### What's New

#### üñºÔ∏è Automatic Photo Fetching
- Photos are automatically fetched from Google Photos shared albums
- Simply paste a share URL and photos appear on your site
- No manual uploading of individual images required
- Photos update automatically when you add them to the album (after cache expires)

#### üíé Beautiful Photo Lightbox
- Full-screen photo viewer
- Keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, ESC to close)
- Touch/swipe support for mobile
- Photo counter (e.g., "5 / 42")
- Download original photo button
- Smooth animations and transitions

#### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations
- **Intelligent Caching**: Photos cached for 24 hours to minimize API calls
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load as you scroll for faster page load
- **Multiple Image Sizes**: Thumbnail (400px), Medium (1200px), Full (2400px), Original
- **Responsive Images**: Automatically serves optimal size for each device

#### üé® Multiple Display Modes
- **Grid View**: Modern responsive grid layout (default)
- **Carousel**: Horizontal scrolling slider
- Switch between modes in the customizer

#### üîß Admin Features
- New settings page: **Settings ‚Üí Google Photos API**
- Optional OAuth setup for advanced features
- One-click cache clearing
- Works immediately with public share URLs (no API key needed!)

### How It Works

The theme uses an intelligent approach:

1. **Basic Mode** (Default): Fetches photos from public share URLs
   - No setup required
   - Works immediately
   - Perfect for most users

2. **Advanced Mode** (Optional): Uses official Google Photos API
   - More reliable for high traffic sites
   - Better rate limiting
   - Requires OAuth setup

### Setup is Simple

1. Share your Google Photos album (toggle "Link sharing" ON)
2. Copy the share URL
3. Go to **Appearance ‚Üí Customize ‚Üí Photo Gallery**
4. Paste the URL
5. Done! Photos appear automatically

See [GOOGLE-PHOTOS-API-SETUP.md](GOOGLE-PHOTOS-API-SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Fixed**: Gallery page showing "Nothing Found" due to slug conflict with gallery custom post type
- **Solution**: Set `has_archive` to `false` for gallery CPT, allowing `/gallery/` page to work
