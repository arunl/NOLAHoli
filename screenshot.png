This is a placeholder for the theme screenshot. 

To add a proper screenshot:
1. Create a 1200 x 900 pixel image showing the theme's home page
2. Save it as "screenshot.png" in the theme root directory
3. This will appear in Appearance â†’ Themes in WordPress admin

Recommended: Capture the hero section and part of the home page content to showcase the Mardi Gras colors and festival theme.
