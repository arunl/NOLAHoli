## Session 2: Gallery Enhancement with Google Photos Integration

### Problem Identified
**User Request:** "Using WP basic support, I have to upload all my pictures and videos and then create gallery entry for each individually. That's a very tedious process."

**Proposed Solution:** Pull photos directly from Google Photos albums via URL, display in carousel or grid.

### What Was Built (v1.1.0)

#### 1. Theme Customizer: Photo Gallery Section
Added to `functions.php`:
- **Gallery Display Style** - Dropdown (Grid View / Carousel Slider)
- **2026 Google Photos Album URL** - Text field for album link
- **2025 Google Photos Album URL** - Pre-filled with existing album
- **2024 Google Photos Album URL** - Pre-filled with existing album

#### 2. Enhanced Gallery Template
Completely rewrote `page-templates/template-gallery.php`:
- Dynamic year tabs based on which albums have URLs
- Embedded Google Photos albums using iFrames
- "Open Gallery" buttons linking to full albums
- Automatic display of available years
- Fallback message if no albums configured

#### 3. Benefits
- ✅ No manual photo uploads needed
- ✅ Just paste album URL once per year
- ✅ Photos auto-update when added to Google Photos
- ✅ Better performance (Google CDN)
- ✅ Visitors can view full albums, download photos

#### 4. Documentation
Created `GALLERY-SETUP.md`:
- Complete setup instructions
- How to get Google Photos album URLs
- Best practices for album organization
- Troubleshooting guide
- Privacy settings recommendations

### Commits

## Session 3: Troubleshooting & Bug Fixes

### Issue: Gallery Page Not Working

#### Problem Report
- User uploaded theme to Dreamhost staging site
- Created Gallery page with Gallery template assigned
- Visiting `/gallery/` showed "Nothing Found" error
- HTTP 200 response (page exists) but content not displaying

#### Troubleshooting Steps Taken

1. **Verified Template Upload**
   - Confirmed `template-gallery.php` exists on server
   - Code modifications present and correct

2. **Checked Customizer Settings**
   - Gallery customizer settings present
   - Default album URLs populated

3. **Enabled Debug Mode**
   - Modified `wp-config.php` to enable `WP_DEBUG`
   - Checked error logs (empty - no PHP errors)

4. **Examined Server Logs**
   - Access log showed HTTP 200 (page loading successfully)
   - No HTTP errors or 404s

5. **Created Test Templates**
   - `template-gallery-test.php` - Basic test
   - `template-gallery-simple.php` - Without theme mods
   - `template-gallery-with-mods.php` - With theme mods
   - `template-gallery-minimal.php` - Minimal test

6. **Analyzed Behavior**
   - "Nothing Found" message from `index.php` (line 63)
   - WordPress falling back to index.php instead of using template
   - Template dropdown showed options but not applying

7. **Key Discovery**
   - User tested with Organizers template - worked fine
   - Changed template name to "Gallery Test" - broke
   - **Issue was specific to the word "Gallery"**

#### Root Cause Found
**User's Discovery:** "It has to do with the slug being named gallery. Changing it to photos or anything else works fine."

**Analysis:**
- Gallery custom post type registered with `'has_archive' => true`
- This reserves `/gallery/` URL for post type archive
- Page with slug "gallery" conflicts with post type archive
- WordPress shows empty archive (no posts) = "Nothing Found"

### Solution Implemented (v1.1.1)

#### Fix Applied
Modified `functions.php` line 241:
```php
// Before
'has_archive'   => true,  // Reserves /gallery/ for post archive

// After  
'has_archive'   => false,  // Allows /gallery/ page to work
```

Added comment explaining the change:
```php
// Gallery Post Type
// Note: has_archive set to false to avoid conflict with /gallery/ page
```

#### Why This Works
- Gallery post type no longer claims `/gallery/` URL
- Page can use `/gallery/` slug without conflict
- Since we're using Google Photos integration, don't need post type archive anyway

#### Cleanup
- Deleted test templates used for debugging
- Kept only production templates

### Commit
```
Commit: 088c402
Tag: v1.1.1
Message: Fix: Gallery page slug conflict
- Changed Gallery post type has_archive to false
- Prevents conflict with /gallery/ page slug
- Gallery page can now use /gallery/ URL without issues
- Removed test templates used for debugging
```

## Key Learnings & Best Practices

### WordPress Custom Post Types
- **Lesson:** Setting `'has_archive' => true` reserves URL slug
- **Solution:** Only enable archives when actually needed
- **Tip:** Document slug conflicts in code comments

### Google Photos Integration
- **Benefit:** Eliminates manual photo management
- **Implementation:** iFrame embed + direct album links
- **UX:** Year-based tabs for easy navigation

### Theme Development Workflow
1. Version control from day one (Git)
2. Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
3. Descriptive commit messages
4. Tag releases for easy rollback
5. Document as you go

### Debugging WordPress Issues
1. Enable WP_DEBUG for error visibility
2. Check server logs (access.log, error.log)
3. Create minimal test cases to isolate issues
4. Test with different page slugs/URLs
5. Verify file uploads completed successfully
